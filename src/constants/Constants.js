const info = `"Hi, I'm Vivek, a web developer and UI/UX designer with a passion for
            creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital
            experiences. With 2.5 years of experience in the field. I am always
            looking for new and innovative ways to bring my clients' visions to
            life. I believe that design is about more than just making things
            look pretty â€“ it's about solving problems and creating intuitive,
            enjoyable experiences for users. Whether I'm working on a website,
            mobile app, or other digital product, I bring my commitment to
            design excellence and user-centered thinking to every project I work
            on. I look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion
            to your next project."`;
