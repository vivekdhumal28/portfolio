            creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital

            look pretty â€“ it's about solving problems and creating intuitive,
            enjoyable experiences for users. Whether I'm working on a website,
            mobile app, or other digital product, I bring my commitment to
            design excellence and user-centered thinking to every project I work

const experienceInfo = `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce euismod
          augue at velit volutpat. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is
          not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
          literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard
          McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
          looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
          Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
          classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
          comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
          Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
          This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
          the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
          amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.`;
